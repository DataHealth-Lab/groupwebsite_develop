      subtitle: "An team tackling urgent health challenges"
      text: |
        The  <span style="color: #009E73; font-weight: 600;">DataHealth Lab</span> is an emerging research group dedicated to producing **high-quality**, **policy-relevant science** that addresses today's most pressing health challenges. We work across Epidemiology, Data Science, Clinical Research, and Implementation Science, with special attention to vulnerable populations and the systems shaping their lives.    
        
        Founded and led by [Otavio Ranzani](https://datahealthlab.org/author/otavio-ranzani/), the lab is grounded in a commitment to scientific rigour, openness, and equity (our values below). [Our work](https://datahealthlab.org/research) spans Critical Care & Innovation, Climate and Environmental Health, Emerging Infections, and Access to Quality Care – always aiming to produce evidence that is both **methodologically sound** and **socially meaningful**.  
        
        We **collaborate** across disciplines and borders, employing tools – from randomized trials to causal inference and artificial intelligence. Whether generating new insights or amplifying underrepresented voices, we turn data into actionable solutions for a healthier world.
        
        Though early in our journey, we've secured funding from national and international agencies, led high-tier, highly-cited [publications](https://datahealthlab.org/publication) (*Lancet*, *JAMA*, *BMJ*, etc), community [impact](https://datahealthlab.org/impact) and advancements in scientific methods and knowledge.
