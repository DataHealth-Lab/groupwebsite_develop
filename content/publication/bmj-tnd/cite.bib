              Objective
              To estimate the effectiveness of the inactivated whole virus vaccine, CoronaVac (Sinovac Biotech), against symptomatic covid-19 in the elderly population of São Paulo state, Brazil during widespread circulation of the gamma variant.
            
            
              Design
              Test negative case-control study.
            
            
              Setting
              Community testing for covid-19 in São Paulo state, Brazil.
            
            
              Participants
              43 774 adults aged ≥70 years who were residents of São Paulo state and underwent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 from 17 January to 29 April 2021. 26 433 cases with symptomatic covid-19 and 17 622 test negative controls with covid-19 symptoms were formed into 13 283 matched sets, one case with to up to five controls, according to age, sex, self-reported race, municipality of residence, previous covid-19 status, and date of RT-PCR test (±3 days).
            
            
              Intervention
              Vaccination with a two dose regimen of CoronaVac.
            
            
              Main outcome measures
              RT-PCR confirmed symptomatic covid-19 and associated hospital admissions and deaths.
            
            
              Results
              Adjusted vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic covid-19 was 24.7\% (95\% confidence interval 14.7\% to 33.4\%) at 0-13 days and 46.8\% (38.7\% to 53.8\%) at ≥14 days after the second dose. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness against hospital admissions was 55.5\% (46.5\% to 62.9\%) and against deaths was 61.2\% (48.9\% to 70.5\%) at ≥14 days after the second dose. Vaccine effectiveness ≥14 days after the second dose was highest for the youngest age group (70-74 years)—59.0\% (43.7\% to 70.2\%) against symptomatic disease, 77.6\% (62.5\% to 86.7\%) against hospital admissions, and 83.9\% (59.2\% to 93.7\%) against deaths—and declined with increasing age.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Vaccination with CoronaVac was associated with a reduction in symptomatic covid-19, hospital admissions, and deaths in adults aged ≥70 years in a setting with extensive transmission of the gamma variant. Vaccine protection was, however, low until completion of the two dose regimen, and vaccine effectiveness was observe to decline with increasing age among this elderly population.},
