## üß¨ Leading-Edge Research on Tuberculosis

**Long-Term Outcomes After TB Disease**

---

### üìú Background  

Tuberculosis (TB) is a model of chronic respiratory infection. During my PhD, I conducted **population-based, longitudinal research** on TB in S√£o Paulo State, Brazil (~44 million inhabitants), following patients newly diagnosed between 2010‚Äì2015 for over five years.  

At the start of Otavio's PhD, **Post-TB Lung Disease** was an emerging field, which has now become **consolidated and is gaining importance**, particularly in quantifying the long-term burden of TB. Using record linkage methods between administrative and health big databases, we quantified **mortality and cause-specific outcomes**, contributing foundational knowledge to this area.  

We also considered the vulnerable determinants of long-term outcomes of TB, including biological (diabetes and mental diseases), social (homelessness and incarcerated individuals) and health behaviour (alcohol and drug use).

### üî¨ My Contribution  

- **Big Data Integration:** Linked multiple big databases to track TB patients longitudinally.  
- **Study Design & Analysis:** Led the design, statistical analysis, and interpretation of long-term outcomes.  
- **Publications & Dissemination:** First-author on a landmark Lancet Infect Dis study, plus three additional TB articles from my thesis.

### üåç Impact  

- Provided **robust evidence on long-term mortality** after TB.  
- Contributed to the **consolidation of Post-TB Lung Disease as an important research area**, particularly in quantifying its burden.  
- Influenced **national TB program strategies**, including recommendations for post-TB patient care.  
- Findings cited in **Post-TB Lung Disease guidelines** and discussed in **national/international media**.  
- Advanced understanding of **determinants, prognostic biomarkers, and potential mitigation strategies** for post-TB sequelae.
