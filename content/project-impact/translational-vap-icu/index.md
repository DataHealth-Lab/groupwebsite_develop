## üß† Pioneering Translational Research

**From Pathophysiology to Clinical Trial in Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP)**

---

### üìú Background  

Translating discoveries from the laboratory to clinical trials is **rare and challenging**, especially in critical care. During Otavio's research fellowship in 2011‚Äîsupported by **ALAT-SEPAR (Latin American & Spanish Pulmonary Societies)**‚Äî he joined a [leading translational research group](https://www.idibapsrespiratoryresearch.org/), led by Prof. Antoni Torres, at **Hospital Cl√≠nic-IDIBAPS (Barcelona)**, investigating the **role of gravity in the pathophysiology of VAP**.  

This work integrated **medicine, engineering, and physics**, challenging a longstanding critical care dogma: that patients should remain semi-recumbent to prevent VAP.

### üî¨ My Contribution  

- **Bench Experiments:** First-author work on in vitro studies using artificial saliva to model secretion dynamics in endotracheal tubes under gravitational influence.  
- **Animal Models:** Contributed to large-scale porcine models simulating severe VAP.  
- **Clinical Translation:** Designed and co-led analyses for the **GRAVITY-VAP Trial**, a **randomized multicenter clinical trial** testing these hypotheses in humans.  

The trial was presented in the **Clinical Trials Session at LIVES 2017 (Vienna)**‚Äîan acknowledgment reserved for impactful research in intensive care medicine.
