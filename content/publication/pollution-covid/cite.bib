              The association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollutants and severe COVID-19 is uncertain. We followed 4,660,502 adults from the general population in 2020 in Catalonia, Spain. Cox proportional models were fit to evaluate the association between annual averages of PM

              at each participant’s residential address and severe COVID-19. Higher exposure to PM

              NO
              2,
              and BC was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization, ICU admission, death, and hospital length of stay. An increase of 3.2 µg/m

              was associated with a 19\% (95\% CI, 16–21) increase in hospitalizations. An increase of 16.1 µg/m
