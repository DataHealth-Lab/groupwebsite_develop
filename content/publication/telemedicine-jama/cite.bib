	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Despite its implementation in several countries, there has not been a randomized clinical trial to assess whether telemedicine in intensive care units  (ICUs) could improve clinical outcomes of critically ill patients. OBJECTIVE: To  determine whether an intervention comprising daily multidisciplinary rounds and  monthly audit and feedback meetings performed by a remote board-certified  intensivist reduces ICU length of stay (LOS) compared with usual care. DESIGN,  SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A parallel cluster randomized clinical trial with a  baseline period in 30 general ICUs in Brazil in which daily multidisciplinary  rounds performed by board-certified intensivists were not routinely available.  All consecutive adult patients (aged ≥18 years) admitted to the participating  ICUs, excluding those admitted due to justice-related issues, were enrolled  between June 1, 2019, and April 7, 2021, with last follow-up on July 6, 2021.  INTERVENTION: Remote daily multidisciplinary rounds led by a board-certified  intensivist through telemedicine, monthly audit and feedback meetings for  discussion of ICU performance indicators, and provision of evidence-based  clinical protocols. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was ICU LOS  at the patient level. Secondary outcomes included ICU efficiency, in-hospital  mortality, incidence of central line-associated bloodstream infections,  ventilator-associated events, catheter-associated urinary tract infections,  ventilator-free days at 28 days, patient-days receiving oral or enteral feeding,  patient-days under light sedation, and rate of patients with oxygen saturation  values under that of normoxemia, assessed using generalized linear mixed models.  RESULTS: Among 17 024 patients (1794 in the baseline period and 15 230 in the  intervention period), the mean (SD) age was 61 (18) years, 44.7\% were female, the  median (IQR) Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 6 (2-9), and 45.5\%  were invasively mechanically ventilated at admission. The median (IQR) time under  intervention was 20 (16-21) months. Mean (SD) ICU LOS, adjusted for baseline  assessment, did not differ significantly between the tele-critical care and usual  care groups (8.1 [10.0] and 7.1 [9.0] days; percentage change, 8.2\% [95\% CI,  -5.4\% to 23.8\%]; P = .24). Results were similar in sensitivity analyses and  prespecified subgroups. There were no statistically significant differences in  any other secondary or exploratory outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Daily  multidisciplinary rounds conducted by a board-certified intensivist through  telemedicine did not reduce ICU LOS in critically ill adult patients.
