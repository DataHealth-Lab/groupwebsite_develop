🌍 **The Global Climate and Health Summit 2025** took place on **16–17 July** at the QEII Centre in London and online, gathering in person **200 multidisciplinary leaders** in science, health, policy, and advocacy from across the world. I had the honor of serving as one of the **Vice-Chairs** of this remarkable event, supported by the [**Wellcome Trust**](https://wellcome.org/) and organized by [**The Physiological Society**](https://www.physoc.org/).

Climate change is the **greatest health threat** of our time. From worsening air pollution to heatwaves, floods, and malnutrition, the effects are widespread and growing. This Summit aimed to **catalyze collective action**, bringing together scientists, policymakers, funders, and people with lived experiences of climate-related health impacts to co-create **real-world, scalable solutions**.

During the event, I also **moderated the Innovation ThinkTank on Air Pollution**, where innovators presented projects aimed at tackling global air pollution health challenges. This high-energy session connected researchers with potential collaborators and supporters to help scale their ideas globally.

🏛️ As a **Steering Group** member, I worked alongside brilliant colleagues, including Professor Mike Tipton (Chair), Dr Fortunate Machingura, and Dr Anh Vu. You can see the full Steering Group here:

📄 As a key output of the Summit, we produced a **Guiding Principles Consensus Statement**. It’s a foundational document aiming to unite global voices around shared values and priorities at the intersection of **climate and health**.

This Summit was a powerful reminder that science, collaboration, and equity must be at the heart of climate action.

Let’s keep building momentum — for people, for health, and for the planet. 🌱
