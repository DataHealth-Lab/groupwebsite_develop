*I view science as a social construct essential for enhancing and promoting the health and well-being of individuals.*

I am a scientist with a **far-reaching understanding** of current societal health issues, with a **robust methodological reasoning** and international experience. I completed my medical degree (summa cum laude, 2008) and clinical training (2014) in Internal Medicine & Critical Care in Brazil, with periods in Italy and Spain. In 2015, I obtained a MSc in Epidemiology from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (Award Distinction), and in 2018, my PhD from the University of SÃ£o Paulo in collaboration with LSHTM.

My research is centred on using data to assess disease mechanisms and generate real-world evidence through an in-depth epidemiological lens. I also work on Implementation Science and Clinical Trials â€” both methodologically and in applied settings â€” integrating causal inference, exposome concepts, and modern analytics. I am highly committed to these [values](https://datahealthlab.org/about#values) in leading my research group.

I completed a Research Fellowship (ERS, 2016) at Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, a postdoctoral and Assistant Professor positions at [ISGlobal](https://www.isglobal.org) (Sara Borrell Fellow). In 2024, I was awarded the prestigious **Ramon y Cajal Fellowship** from the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities and by the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), which supports my role as Emerging Group Leader at [IR SANT PAU](https://datahealthlab.org/about#ir_santpau).

I am the **Principal Investigator** of the [DataHealth Lab](https://datahealthlab.org), where I supervise undergraduates, Master and PhD students, postdocs, and junior researchers. My group receives support from competitive funding, including national and international grants and we are actively involved in international networks.

Our work has informed policy discussions on severe infections, air pollution, vaccines, and health systems. I serve as Associate Editor for a leading journal in Critical Care and contribute to teaching at postgraduate programs in epidemiology and global health.
