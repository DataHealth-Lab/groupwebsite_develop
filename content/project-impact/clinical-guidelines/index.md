In the context of research **impact evaluation**, a key pathway to achieving real-world change is the **translation of evidence into policy and clinical practice**. Our group actively contributes to this process through involvement in the development of **clinical guidelines, consensus statements, and policy documents**. We bring together **methodological expertise**, **clinical experience**, and a **global perspective**, ensuring that our contributions are both rigorous and relevant.

We have played leadership roles in several national and international initiatives, and our research has been cited in recommendations issued by the **World Health Organization**, **national health ministries**, and **leading medical societies**. These efforts reflect our commitment to advancing science that informs practice and improves health outcomes worldwide.
