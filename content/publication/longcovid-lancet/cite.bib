	abstract = {Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection can develop symptoms that persist well beyond the acute phase of COVID-19 or emerge after the acute phase, lasting for  weeks or months after the initial acute illness. The post-acute sequelae of  COVID-19, which include physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments, are  known collectively as long COVID or post-COVID-19 condition. The substantial  burden of this multisystem condition is felt at individual, health-care system,  and socioeconomic levels, on an unprecedented scale. Survivors of  COVID-19-related critical illness are at risk of the well known sequelae of acute  respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and chronic critical illness, and these  multidimensional morbidities might be difficult to differentiate from the  specific effects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. We provide an overview of the  manifestations of post-COVID-19 condition after critical illness in adults. We  explore the effects on various organ systems, describe potential  pathophysiological mechanisms, and consider the challenges of providing clinical  care and support for survivors of critical illness with multisystem  manifestations. Research is needed to reduce the incidence of post-acute sequelae  of COVID-19-related critical illness and to optimise therapeutic and  rehabilitative care and support for patients.},
