I'm fifth year resident in Anesthesiology and Intensive Care at the University of Genova. During my residency I had the chance to work abroad in Brussels (Hopital Erasme), Sao Paulo (Hospital das Clinicas) and finally Barcelona (Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau). I speak Italian, English, French, Portuguese and Spanish as I like to meet and work in different contexts. I developed an interesent in research in the last years, especially in the neurologic and cardiologic critical care. My current ambition would be to continue studying and deepen my knowledge in methodology and statistics.
